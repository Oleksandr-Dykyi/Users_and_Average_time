## Users_and_Average_time

#### Technology Stack:
Tableau (calculated fields, function, dashboard creation)

#### Project Description:
In this project, I utilized Tableau to gain valuable insights into user behavior and average time spent in the game.

Within a workbook, I developed three distinct sheets, each providing unique perspectives on user engagement:

User Metrics by Month: This sheet presented two key metrics on a monthly basis: the total number of game users and the percentage of total users who engaged in Battle pass-related activities.

Average Time Spent: I created a sheet that showcased the average time spent in the game per player, broken down by month. To enhance usability, I added a label displaying the average time in hours and minutes (in "HH:MM" format) for user, ensuring clear and concise communication of the data.

Heat Map Analysis: I designed a heat map that visualized the average amount of time spent in the game across different dimensions: age groups of players (in 5-year increments) and activity date quarters.

To streamline data exploration, I consolidated all three sheets into a single dashboard. The dashboard incorporated interactive filters, allowing users to refine their analysis by adjusting parameters such as date of activity, age group, game name, and user device language.
